Writing
=======

    I have about a million half-finished short pieces of writing that I
    want to be able to browse for inspiration later. What do I do with
    them?

    Give them to other people to try and write the next bit of the story.
    Kinda like the 'consequences' game

    Put them on github and see if anybody wants to help finish?

    Put them on a wiki. If you're feeling brave, make it a public one.

So here they are, a repository of my half-finished pieces of writing.
Things that I've started to write or scribbled notes for but never got
around to finishing.

This knowledge wants to be free. Fork the project, add your opinions,
publish the articles. I'd like if you linked to [me][1] or to this
project but that's entirely up to you.

For the avoidance of doubt, this work is released under the WTFPL. The
full text as well as a discussion of the implications of the WTFPL is
available [online][2].
