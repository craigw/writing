Some pet peeves of mine are about working with arrays.

Ask an array if it's empty. Don't check if it has a size greater than
zero.

    bookmarks.empty?    # Do this.
    bookmarks.size == 0 # ARGH! NO!

If you want to check if an array is not empty, consider asking if it
contains anything:

    bookmarks.any?     # Do this.
    bookmarks.size > 0 # No! Bad panda!

Don't check if it's empty before iterating over it unless you need to do
something with the empty case.

    if bookmarks.any? # Pointless if statement
      render :partial => bookmarks
    end

This does the same thing:

    render :partial => bookmarks

This is acceptable:

    if bookmarks.any? # Yes, okay then, this works
      render :partial => bookmarks
    else
      render :partial => "no_bookmarks"
    end
