You'll need to do this for each box you control that's not the Chef server. It
only needs to be done once on each box. We setup the box to talk to the chef 
server. After that all system setup and configuration type tasks should be 
done through Chef.

SSH into your new box and do these things:

  sudo apt-get install curl --yes

  # Add the Opscode APT repository so we can get chef goodies.
  sudo su -c 'echo "deb http://apt.opscode.com/ `lsb_release -sc` universe" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opscode.list'
  # Add the Opscode key so we can verify the packages
  sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com         2940ABA983EF826A |sudo apt-key add -

  # Add jtimberman's PPA for Opscode Ubuntu packages so we can get Chef 0.8 packages
  sudo su -c 'echo "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/jtimberman/opschef/ubuntu `lsb_release -sc` main
  deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/jtimberman/opschef/ubuntu `lsb_release -sc` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ppa-chef.list'
  # Add the PPA key so we can verify the packages
  sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com         2179D1803F95EA18 |sudo apt-key add -

  # Enable multiverse if it's not already enabled by doing this:
  # sudo su -c 'echo "deb http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ `lsb_release -sc` multiverse
  # deb-src http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ `lsb_release -sc` multiverse
  # deb http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ `lsb_release -sc`-updates multiverse
  # deb-src http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ `lsb_release -sc`-updates multiverse
  # deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu `lsb_release -sc`-security multiverse
  # deb-src http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu `lsb_release -sc`-security multiverse" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/multiverse.list'

  # Fetch the latest indexes from the apt repositories we have configured
  sudo apt-get update

  # Install the Chef client
  echo "chef chef/chef_server_url string http://chef.xeriom.net:4000" | \
       sudo debconf-set-selections
  sudo apt-get install chef rubygems ohai ruby1.8-dev --yes

  # As part of the Chef client registration process we need to validate the 
  # client account. This can all be done automatically as long as we copy from 
  # the chef server to the new client the file /etc/chef/validation.pem. You 
  # should treat this file like a root password for the entire 
  # infrastructure... set your umask appropriately before copying it, and 
  # don't leave it lying around anywhere. Copy the file to 
  # /etc/chef/validation.pem now.

  # Run the chef-client for the first time to make sure it's registered
  sudo chef-client
  # It should either say that the Chef run completed or give you an error 
  # message.

  # That's it, the Chef client has been registered. Now delete that validation 
  # key!
  sudo rm /etc/chef/validation.pem
